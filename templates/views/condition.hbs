                    <p class="mb-3"><b> Camera Surveillance</b><br> 

                        Finance Strategies uses camera surveillance where permitted by the Belgian law of March 21,
                        2007. The recording is securely stored and only accessible on a need-to-know basis (for example,
                        to look into an incident). We are allowed to disclose recording to law enforcement bodies. We
                        will also share CCTV images with our insurers for purposes of processing an insurance claim as a
                        result of an incident. The recordings are typically deleted or automatically overwritten after a
                        short period of time unless an issue is identified that requires further investigation.
                    </p>
